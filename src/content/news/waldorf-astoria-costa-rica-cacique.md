## Opening in November 2024

Hilton has plans to open the Waldorf Astoria Costa Rica Cacique in November 2024, with the new property taking up residence on the Pacific coastline of the Guanacaste province, a short 40-minute drive to Daniel Oduber Quirós International Airport in Liberia.

The new hotel will be in good company, as this part of Costa Rica is already home to other luxury properties, such as Four Seasons Peninsula Papagayo, JW Marriott Guanacaste Resort & Spa, and Andaz Costa Rica Resort at Peninsula Papagayo.

Located on a dramatic cliffside peninsula and overlooking the secluded Playa Penca, the hotel stands to be a luxurious and relaxing retreat for guests while still providing easy access to many nearby activities.

The hotel will have 188 guest rooms alongside lavish private residences, and guests will be able to enjoy a variety of amenities including a multi-level pool, on-site restaurants, a spa, a fitness centre, and more.

The hotel’s use of wood and light-coloured stone elements imbues the indoor spaces with a warm and contemporary aesthetic, which is a pleasant complement to the lush, rainforest surroundings.

Additionally, the layout of the hotel has been designed to fit naturally within the landscape’s terrain as it angles towards the ocean, and wildlife corridors have been incorporated to ensure the safety of the local fauna.

This newest Waldorf Astoria property has been in development for over 10 years, so the excitement and anticipation has certainly had time to grow. With any luck, an official opening date will be announced shortly, and travellers can begin to plan their stays.
