# Fairmont Announces its Return to New Orleans

Fairmont Hotels & Resorts has announced that it will open a new luxury hotel in New Orleans two decades after the original Fairmont New Orleans closed following Hurricane Katrina. The new Fairmont New Orleans is scheduled to open in Summer 2025, bringing with it a sense of renewal and revival.

## The New Fairmont New Orleans

The new Fairmont New Orleans is set to welcome its first guests in Summer 2025, as part of an exciting redevelopment project in New Orleans’s Central Business District. From its central location one block from the historic French Quarter, this new hotel provides guests with excellent access to New Orleans’s amazing food, music, and activities.

The new hotel will occupy 18 stories, offering 250 luxury guest rooms, including 40 suites. The property will include three on-site food and drink venues, including a restaurant, a lobby lounge, and a rooftop bar and speakeasy overlooking a swimming pool and the city below. Guests will also be able to enjoy additional amenities such as the 10,000-square-foot spa, a library, and a business centre. The space also provides several event and meeting spaces to host both corporate and social gatherings.

The hotel’s rooms and shared spaces offer a nod to the city’s unique character in the choice of colour and design, with muted jewel tones being partnered with bold patterns throughout. Plants interspersed among the clean lines of each room add vibrancy, and the furnishings seem to harken to past eras with the inclusion of wicker chairs and walls, plush sofas, and elegant light fixtures. This new Fairmont property is part of Accor’s (Fairmont’s parent company) ambitious plan to open 100 new luxury hotels over the next two years, and so far, it seems to be an exemplary demonstration of the brand’s exquisite style.
