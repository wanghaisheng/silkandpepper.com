The property is designed to take influence from the local landscape and the region’s heritage, presenting spaces that are both chic and modern while also being warm and welcoming. The resort’s colour scheme embodies this with its use of earthen tones, natural textures, and blue accent pieces throughout. The landscaping melds into the rugged coastline, with native plants creating a lushness to offset the desert colouring.

While staying at the resort, guests will be able to enjoy three pools, a swimmable beach, three restaurants and five bars, a luxurious spa, multiple on-site activities and off-site adventures, the Cabo del Sol golf course designed by Fry Straka, and more.

Notable activities offered by the resort include free-diving lessons and certifications, a chance to take in the incredible biodiversity of Magdelena Bay, and if you’re visiting between January and mid-March, the opportunity to take in the serene majesty of the grey whales migrating off the coast.
