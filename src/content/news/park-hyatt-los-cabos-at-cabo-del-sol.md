## Opens in early 2025

The Park Hyatt Los Cabos at Cabo del Sol promises an intimate and luxurious beachfront retreat near downtown Cabo San Lucas.

The property has been designed to complement its surroundings, incorporating beautiful terracing and desert plants in its landscaping, and providing guests with stunning views of the Sea of Cortez.

The hotel’s shared spaces showcase sleek and contemporary design that melds beautifully with a colour scheme chosen to create a seamless visual between the property and the Baja coastline.

The hotel will have 163 rooms, including 88 suites and three villas, with some offering private terraces and plunge pools with ocean views.

Guests will be able to enjoy a variety of amenities including multiple dining venues, five pools, a 20,000-foot spa, 24-hour fitness centre, a yoga studio, access to a golf course, and more.

Although the property has been in development since 2017, and its opening has experienced many unfortunate delays due to supply-chain and other issues, hopes are high that the current early 2025 opening date is accurate (though no official opening date has yet been set).
