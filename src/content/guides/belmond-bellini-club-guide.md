# Belmond Bellini Club Guide

Belmond is a pioneer in luxury travel, operating a multi-service company that originated in 1976 with the purchase of the gorgeous Cipriani hotel in Venice. The Belmond portfolio boasts one-of-a-kind hotels and safari lodges, and further distinguishes itself as a leader in bespoke luxury offerings with train journeys and river cruises. In 2019, Belmond joined LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, solidifying their place as leaders in luxury travel. 

## The Belmond Experience

Belmond offers stunning hotels across much of Europe, as well as one-of-a-kind properties and experiences throughout Asia, Africa, North America, and South America. Currently, the Belmond portfolio boasts 32 luxury hotels, six unique train journeys, and two unforgettable safaris, as well as an upscale New York restaurant and a French riverboat experience.
