# Four Seasons Hotel Seattle

Our Editor-in-Chief, T.J. Dunn enjoyed a stay at the Four Seasons Hotel Seattle in November 2023. T.J. had this to say about his say: “There’s no better way to start the day than being served coffee in bed. The Four Seasons Hotel Seattle’s Coffee Concierge will become your new favourite person.” T.J.’s personal highlights: Buzzing at happy hour at the Goldfinch Tavern, soaking in the view of Puget Sound from the open-air hot tub, and a room that you won’t want to leave.

Perched atop a hill that overlooks the gorgeous Elliott Bay is the Four Seasons Hotel Seattle. If you’re in search of a luxurious stay in the heart of the city, or you’re in need of a blissful escape from the region's notoriously moody weather, you’ve come to the right place.

## Location

The Four Seasons Hotel Seattle is ideally situated for business, leisure, or a combination of the two.

You can’t get any closer to the city’s famed Pike Place Market, where you can sample artisanal goods and catch glimpses of fish being tossed between mongers at seafood shops. If you’re in search of some arts and culture, across the street is the Seattle Art Museum, and a few steps further afield is Benaroya Hall, both located in the heart of the Central Business District. Down a staircase from the hotel is the city’s waterfront, complete with restaurants, attractions, and trails that offer the perfect spot for a morning walk, run, or ride. If you're headed anywhere close, take advantage of the Four Seasons Seattle's complimentary house Tesla car service, which will take you to downtown shops and sights in style. To make your way to or from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in around 20 minutes, opt for the hotel’s private airport transfers in a luxury sedan, or easily make your own arrangements via taxi or rideshare.

You’ll be welcomed to the hotel by the valet staff, who are also valuable resources for queries about where to go in the city and how to get there. Inside, the lobby lounge emits warmth with its multiple fireplaces, perfect for coming back in from a walk in the drizzle. Natural elements in the seating area and on the walls highlight the hotel's home in the Pacific Northwest. As you make your way from the check-in area to the elevators, keep an eye out for complimentary baked goods and a warm beverage on offer by the Concierge desk.

Nestled in the heart of the city, the rooms at the Four Seasons Seattle capture the essence of Seattle's innovative spirit and balance this with unrivaled comfort. As you step into the room, the king bed, clad in immaculate white linens with the Four Seasons logo subtly stitched onto each pillow, promises a night of decadent slumber. To start the day, you could enjoy a Nespresso using the provided machine, but we recommend you treat yourself and not miss out on the coffee concierge service, available from 6am to 10:30am. After a quick call down to the front desk, hotel staff will bring you a fresh cup of coffee without you even having to get out of bed.

The room’s earthy tones are enhanced by the subtle Northwest-inspired décor and warm lighting. Bathed in natural light filtering through gauzy curtains, a cozy nook with a plush chaise longue provides space for quiet thought or peaceful repose. The room is also equipped with modern amenities. The sleek flat-screen TV, positioned perfectly for viewing, sits directly across from the king bed and rests atop a sound bar for an enhanced experience. Nearby, a table for two awaits, perfect for an in-room dining experience – a popular choice among guests – making meals a functional and enjoyable affair. The floor-to-ceiling windows offer moody views of Elliott Bay, showing off the dynamic energy of Seattle and the peaceful waterfront promenade.

In the bathroom, the expansive vanity, with its polished marble countertop, offers ample space, and the large marble soaking bathtub invites you to unwind. The glass-enclosed rain shower, mimicking the famous Seattle rain, provides a rejuvenating experience with every drop. You can also keep an eye out for the model Boeing aircraft in your room, which pays homage to the city's aviation history.

Goldfinch Tavern, the hotel's sole dining establishment, connects seamlessly with the hotel's lobby. Open all week with dedicated hours for breakfast, lunch, happy hour, and dinner, it's rare to find the space not buzzing. As you step inside, rich wood panelling harmonizes with sleek, dark furnishings. Warmed by the soft glow of carefully positioned lights, the space transforms into an intimate cocoon, ideal for guests seeking solace in stylish comfort. For the best experience, opt for a table by the expansive glass windows to enjoy views of Elliott Bay, or retreat to a private booth for a more intimate affair.
