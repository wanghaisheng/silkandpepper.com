# Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong

Prince Collection’s Founder & CEO Ricky Zhang stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong in February 2023. He was most impressed by the hotel’s status amongst Hong Kong’s “see and be seen” crowd, as well as the numerous fine dining establishments and the elevated service culture from start to finish. Situated in the heart of Hong Kong’s financial district, the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong is among the most sought-after luxury hotels in the city. As the flagship hotel of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group, this property holds a special place in Hong Kong’s history, as it boasts sweeping harbour views, impeccable service, a Michelin-starred restaurant, and award-winning cocktails.

## Location

The Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong is located in the middle of the bustling Central district at the heart of Hong Kong’s financial centre.

The hotel opened in 1963 right next to the harbour of Hong Kong Island and, at the time, was the tallest building in the neighbourhood. Over the years, the island has expanded with reclaimed land, and new skyscrapers have popped up all around the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong, giving the hotel a more subdued, but no less prolific, profile.

## Check-in

The exemplary service at the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong begins as soon as you arrive, with a warm greeting from the staff as you enter the spacious lobby.

The lobby pays homage to the Mandarin Oriental’s Chinese roots through the soaring ceilings, dazzling chandeliers, and a harmonious blend of deep reds and golds. The clever interplay of bold floor patterns, rich colours, and textures imbues the space with a contemporary and eclectic feel, melding together the past and the present. The gracious hotel staff will facilitate your check-in to the right of the lobby in a separate check-in area.

## Rooms and Suites

The Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong offers many different room types, ranging from simple guest rooms to palatial suites. No matter which room you book, you’ll encounter rooms with old-school charm marked by traditional jade-green finishes, splashes of red lacquer colour, and copper accents.

Of note is the hotel’s Michelin-starred restaurant, Man Wah, situated on the 25th floor. Here, guests can enjoy a refined Cantonese dining experience complete with views of Victoria Harbour. The restaurant’s Art Deco style, featuring dark-blue walls and a gold and blue accented carpet, creates a modern and chic look. Also on the 25th floor, The Aubrey is a super-trendy Japanese izakaya with a lively bar that's been recognized as one of Asia’s 50 Best Bars. The venue exudes trendy glamour, with a stylish dining room, plush furnishings, large chandeliers, and lots of greenery.

Moreover, the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong is home to the Krug Room, a fine dining restaurant created in partnership with the famous House of Krug. The space offers the largest collection of Krug Champagne outside of France. Aside from these, you can select from five other on-site venues, ranging from the Clipper Lounge (a famous after-work watering hole), to the Mandarin Grill + Bar (a swanky eatery with modern European dishes), to the Chinnery (a cozy British-style pub), and more.

## Conclusion

The Mandarin Oriental serves as a very inspired luxury property choice in the heart of Hong Kong Island, in large part thanks to the hotel’s historic stature, which results in a palpable “see and be seen” factor that exists within its halls. The hotel’s very impressive lineup of food and drink outlets, including two-Michelin-starred Cantonese fare at Man Wah and the absolutely electric vibe at The Aubrey, adds to its cachet. Room rates for the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong begin at 4,000–5,000 HKD ($510–638 USD, $680–850 CAD) for a standard room. When booking at the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong, it’s always recommended to go through an authorized travel advisor so that you can enjoy access to the Mandarin Oriental Fan Club, a preferred partner program that provides a suite of extra benefits during your stay at no additional cost.
