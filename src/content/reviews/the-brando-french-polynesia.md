# The Brando

Set amidst the pristine, turquoise waters and breathtaking archipelagos of the vast South Pacific, The Brando stands unrivaled in the realm of exclusivity and eco-luxury. Tetiaroa, an atoll of a dozen idyllic islands surrounding a turquoise lagoon, warmly cradles The Brando's collection of luxurious eco-villas. These accommodations are scattered within a canvas of flora and fauna, diverse marine life, and unspoiled coral reefs. 

The atoll once served as the home to Tahitian royalty, where kings and queens made it their private paradise. The untamed islands also captured the heart of Marlon Brando while filming 'Mutiny on the Bounty' in 1960. Drawn in by its raw beauty, he vowed to shield these islands from change, preserving their natural state for generations to come.

## Location

French Polynesia is made up of 121 vibrant islands within the Pacific Ocean. While islands like Tahiti and Bora Bora are hubs of tourist activity, the larger proportion of the islands sustains rural communities of native Polynesians. Located 53 kilometres north of Tahiti, The Brando offers unmatched privacy, nestled within the Tetiaroa atoll and accompanied by twelve scenic islets.

This atoll, with its lush vegetation and azure waters, rose as a volcanic peak more than three million years ago, sharing its origin with the famous sister islands of Tahiti, Moorea, and Bora Bora. The Brando is situated on Onetahi, a motu that unfolds over 193 acres of coral island. This is the only spot in the atoll that opens its doors to visitors, as the remaining islands are devoted to conserving the beauty of the atoll, and safeguarding the diversity that inhabits it.

## Arrival and Check-In

To make your way to Tetiaroa, you'll first need to fly into Papeete, the capital of French Polynesia. From there, Air Tetiaroa will whisk you away, cutting across the deep blue skies and transporting you directly to The Brando.

## One-Bedroom Villa

At The Brando, a mere 35 villas are meticulously placed amidst the abundant, vibrant foliage, which creates unparalleled seclusion for each villa. Nestled on the shores of white-sand beaches, every villa is a sanctuary outfitted with its own private plunge pool, direct access to the beach, and enveloped by tropical gardens flourishing with coconut palms. The interiors of the villas at The Brando emanate a symphony of luxury and comfort, adorned with creamy tones that are elegantly offset by accents of both dark and light shades, with each villa comprising a main living room, a bedroom, and a spacious media room, all with contemporary furnishings.

The villas use traditional building methods and incorporate locally sourced materials, such as wooden walls and roofs adorned with pandanus leaves, creating a space that is not just lavish but that is also deeply rooted in and respectful of the local ethos and tradition. Every villa is strategically positioned on the islet to offer views of either Turtle Beach, showcasing breathtaking sunsets, or Mermaid Bay, where instead, the break of the day bathes the sky in golden tones.

A welcoming bottle of Champagne awaits you at the table, a sparkling prelude to the unlimited beverages available as part of the all-inclusive package. The villas feature king beds, plush furnishings, a wall-mounted flat-screen TV, a walk-through closet, an elegant bathroom complete with a rain shower, and a mini-bar.

The villas also showcase an outdoor bathtub, nestled amidst the aromatic tropical garden. Here, you can soak in warm air and the gentle rustle of palm leaves, or relax under the vast, starlit sky at night while bathing in the soft glow of the moon.

Adding to the outdoor experience, each villa boasts a generous deck adorned with a sheltered dining enclave, ideal for indulging in meals amid the fresh, tropical air. There's also the private plunge pool, a standout feature complete with inviting recliners and a shielding umbrella, a serene oasis which, coupled with the lapping waves of the beach and the expansive ocean a few graceful steps away, creates an iconic South Pacific abode.

## Resort Grounds

The resort itself unfolds in two distinctive parts: the lower enclave, home to the luxurious resort, and the elevated section, hosting the airstrip and secluded staff village. A winding pathway encircles the main islet, guiding you through the resort's awe-inspiring grounds, stunning public spaces, and ingeniously concealed villas. For effortless navigation through this slice of heaven, each guest is provided a bicycle; however, for those seeking leisure or simply preferring a laid-back journey, electric carts, steered by staff, stand ready to whisk you to your desired location.

</div>

The villas are sprinkled along the eastern and western beachfronts, offering panoramic views of the shimmering ocean waves and beachfront, while the hubs of activity take place at the public areas and shared facilities nestled at the islet's base. The Resort Centre is the heart of the resort, where you'll find the front desk, restaurants, beach and pool area, activities, a couple shops, and the bar. If you head a bit more inland, towards the northeast, you'll discover the spa and fitness facilities, as well as pathways that lead to stunning views and offer convenient access to the airport runway and secluded beaches alike. 

Interspersed throughout the grounds are marae, the ancient Polynesian stone temples. These marae serve as holy gathering sites, and provide guests with an opportunity to discover and learn more about the rich cultural heritage of the region. The 12 other islets in the atoll of Tetiaroa that are used for natural conservation, which The Brando's revenues help support. Guests can also arrange to take tours of the other islets to interact with and learn more about sustainability efforts.

## Dining

The Brando has four dining establishments plus one bar: the Beachcomber Café, Bob’s Bar, Nami, Les Mutinés, and Te Manu Bar. The Beachcomber Café is the resort's all-day dining restaurant, offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner in a laid-back beachside ambiance, complete with outdoor seating and a picturesque lagoon view. The all-day-dining menu offers a blend of Polynesian, French, and international cuisines, with stand-out seafood dishes such as lagoon fish ceviche, Tahitian raw fish, swordfish carpaccio, rock octopus with pan-fried pineapples, and lobster rolls.

Nami offers a teppanyaki experience curated for an intimate group. The dinner service requires a reservation and is only available on select nights, so we recommend you book early if you’d like to enjoy the exceptional sushi and grill spread. Les Mutinés is nothing short of extraordinary, featuring a full multi-course French menu, complemented by carefully selected wine pairings.

The restaurant's name draws from the renowned film Mutiny on the Bounty, which Marlon Brando was filming when he stumbled upon these islands, and the fine-dining menu focuses on flavours of the region. From appetizers of a Polynesian swordfish tart and shrimp carpaccio to main dishes such as roasted wagyu steak and lagoon fish accompanied by sweet pepper ravioli, your meal at Les Mutinés will be done to perfection.

With its funky-chic beach vibe, Bob's Bar is situated on the beach and serves up South Pacific-inspired food and drinks, drawing inspiration from Marlon’s iconic films.

Te Manu Bar, serves cocktails before and after dinner from its intimate lounge seating which is suspended among a canopy of treetops, providing breathtaking views of the lagoon and the starry sky.

Every element of the hotel has been meticulously designed so as to have as small of an environmental footprint as possible, and much of its revenue goes toward funding research and educational initiatives to keep this island ecosystem healthy and thriving.
